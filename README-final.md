Final summary and documentation for the Competition Auto-Entry System
"""

# The Competition Auto-Entry System provides automated tools for entering online competitions.
# It supports the following features:

# 1. Robust competition entry using Playwright for browser automation
# 2. Computer vision fallback for form detection when DOM methods fail
# 3. Intelligent form field detection and filling
# 4. Screenshot capture for debugging and success/failure documentation
# 5. Comprehensive logging of all operations
# 6. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
# 7. Authentication support for competition websites (e.g., CompetitionCloud)
# 8. Configurable personal information via config files and environment variables

# Key Scripts:
# - competition_auto_entry_final.py: Main entry system with all features
# - test_live_competition.py: Test the system with a local test form
# - test_public_competition.py: Test the system with a public competition site
# - test_final_competition.py: Comprehensive test with authentication and real competition entry

# Main Components:
# - CompetitionAutoEntry: Core class for competition discovery and entry
# - ComputerVisionFormDetector: CV-based fallback for form detection
# - Authentication modules for various competition sites
# - Form field detection and classification logic
# - Form submission and success verification

# Usage:
# 1. Basic form entry (local file):
#    python competition_auto_entry_final.py --test
#
# 2. Public competition entry:
#    python competition_auto_entry_final.py --url "https://example.com/competition"
#
# 3. Authenticated competition entry:
#    python competition_auto_entry_final.py --url "https://competitioncloud.com.au/competition/123" --auth --site competitioncloud
#
# 4. Debug mode (visible browser):
#    Add --headless=false to any command above

# Testing Summary:
# - Local test form: Successfully fills and submits forms with various field types
# - Public Gleam.io competition: Successfully fills email fields and submits the form
# - CompetitionCloud: Authentication had issues in the automated tests
#   (may require manual intervention or site-specific handling)

# Next Steps:
# 1. Address CompetitionCloud authentication issues (site may be using anti-automation measures)
# 2. Expand support for more competition sites
# 3. Implement retry logic for transient failures
# 4. Add more sophisticated form detection for complex sites
# 5. Integrate with the broader competition discovery and tracking system

# The system provides a solid foundation for automated competition entry
# but may require site-specific customization for certain competition platforms.
