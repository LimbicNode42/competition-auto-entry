The Competition Auto-Entry System has been developed to automate the process of
entering online competitions from aggregation websites. The system uses Playwright
for browser automation and computer vision as a fallback for form detection.

Key features implemented:
- Form detection and filling using DOM inspection and computer vision
- Screenshot capture for debugging and success/failure documentation
- Authentication support for competition websites
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Comprehensive logging of all operations

1. Local Test Form (test_form.html):
   ✓ Successfully detected all form fields
   ✓ Correctly filled personal information
   ✓ Found and clicked the submit button
   ✓ Verified successful submission

2. Public Competition (Gleam.io):
   ✓ Successfully navigated to the competition page
   ✓ Detected and filled email fields
   ✓ Used fallback form submission methods when standard buttons not found
   ✓ Verified successful submission

3. CompetitionCloud Authentication:
   ✗ Encountered issues with the login form
   ✗ Possible anti-automation measures or dynamic content loading issues
   ✗ May require site-specific handling or manual intervention

    # Recommendations
    print_section("RECOMMENDATIONS", """
1. CompetitionCloud Authentication:
   - Investigate alternative authentication methods (cookie-based, API-based)
   - Consider implementing site-specific selectors and handlers
   - Add exponential backoff retry logic for login attempts

2. Form Detection Improvements:
   - Enhance field type classification for uncommon field types
   - Add support for captchas and other verification mechanisms
   - Implement adaptive timing for sites with dynamic content loading

3. Error Handling:
   - Add more robust retry logic for transient failures
   - Improve recovery mechanisms for failed authentication
   - Implement session persistence for longer-running tasks

4. Integration:
   - Connect with the competition discovery pipeline
   - Implement a database for tracking entry status
   - Add scheduling for periodic entry attempts

    # Path Forward
    print_section("PATH FORWARD", """
The Competition Auto-Entry System provides a solid foundation for automated
competition entry. The main challenge identified is handling authentication
on sites with anti-automation measures like CompetitionCloud.

Next steps:
1. Focus on reliable authentication for key competition sites
2. Implement a pluggable architecture for site-specific handlers
3. Enhance error recovery and retry mechanisms
4. Integrate with the broader competition discovery and tracking system

For immediate use, the system works well with:
- Local and simple forms
- Public competitions without complex authentication
- Sites that don't employ heavy anti-automation measures
